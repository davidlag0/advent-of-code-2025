This year (2025), I'm doing Advent of Code again with Rust! As I go through the puzzles, I will attempt the challenges on my own and then improve my solutions by looking at other people's code.

## Usage

### Solve puzzles
```sh
$ cargo run <path to folder with input files>
```

### Run tests in current environment
```sh
$ cargo test -- --nocapture
```

## Development

### Prepare Environment
```sh
$ make init
```

### Code coverage (Reference: https://github.com/mozilla/grcov)
```sh
$ make coverage
```
